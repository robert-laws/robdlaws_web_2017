Web Development in 2017 requires a high level of technical and visual skills. Early in the 21st century, web development required painstaking work to create HTML pages and add styling with CSS. Large projects meant huge numbers of files and code that was written independently. Although technologies like Cold Fusion and .Net helped somewhat reduce code replication, there was still a lot to keep track of from project to project (not to mention dealing with compatability issues during the browser wars). The advent of CSS Frameworks, MVC Architecture, Package and Task Managers was meant to make the life of developers easier, and it has. However, it has also created a technical hurdle that prevents pure hobbists from diving head first into all but the most basic of web development technologies. Content Management Systems like WordPress have helped tear down some barriers, but even WordPress requires higher-level skills to produce a polished and professional end-product.

The good news is that for those individuals who are willing to learn the skills necessary to become an expert, or at the very least least a highly proficient amateur, their skills are in demand. The job of Web Developer commonly heads the list of hot jobs and is one of the in-demand skills in the 21st century workforce.

Listed below are a portfolio of different projects - focused on Front-End, Back-End, and Content Management System development.

Although it's possible for the modern web developer to avoid design, I don't recommend it. Even if a web developer isn't an expert in design theory, tools, or application, these are very things to know how to do. I make use of design - particularly focusing on Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign - for things like prototyping, graphics for use on the web, and digital publications.

The words Big Data are all over the headlines these days - but how many people are able, or would want, to try to analyze Big Data in it's raw format? That's where data visualization come in. There's a range of ways of visualize data - using graphs, on maps, or with interactive dashboards, just to name a few.

I've been lucky enough to travel often during the past 10 years. Living overseas has made traveling more accessible and a welcome break. Most of my travels have been in Europe and Germany in particular. I've managed to set my foot into all sixteen of the states of Germany, although there's plenty of opportunity to explore each more thoroughly. I've made journeys to many other places throughout North America and Europe. Displayed is a selection of some of my favorite photos.
